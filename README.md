# Malaria_Classification
ORIGINAL DATA SOURCE:  The dataset contains 2 folders - Infected - Uninfected  And a total of 27,558 images.  Acknowledgements This Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/  *Note: We will be dealing with real image files, NOT numpy arrays. Which means a large part of this process will be learning how to work with and deal with large groups of image files. This is too much data to fit in memory as a numpy array, so we'll need to feed it into our model in batches. *
